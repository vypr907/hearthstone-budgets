## ADR-005: Institutions Support Multiple Categories

Decision:
Replace institutions.category_id (single FK) with a join table, institution_categories
(institution_id, category_id), enabling many-to-many institution-to-category relationships.

Reason:
A single institution can reasonably span more than one spending category (e.g. a retailer
that's both "Pets" and "Household"). A single category_id column couldn't express that.

Status: Implemented 2026-07-28.
