## ADR-008: Undo Is a Full Reversal

Decision:
"Undo" on a cleared bill or debt deletes the associated transactions row, resets
payment_status to 'unpaid', and reverts next_due_date (bills) / remaining_balance (debts)
to their pre-clear values.

Reason:
Undo is meant for correcting an accidental click, not recording a real reversed payment.
Treating it as "that clear never happened" is simpler and matches user intent. A genuine
reversal of real money already moved (e.g. a bounced payment) should be handled as a new
correcting transaction instead, not via Undo.

Note: this narrows Phase 3.5's original "transactions are permanent, never deleted" rule —
that rule still applies to normal history; Undo is the one intentional exception, scoped
only to reversing a same-session mis-click.

Status: Implemented 2026-07-28.
