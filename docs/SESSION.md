## 2026-07-28 – Supabase Schema Migration & Data Import

### Completed

* Migrated `accounts` table to the new schema by:

  * Adding `account_number`, `interest_apy`, `credit_limit`, `account_subtype`, `is_spendable`, and `include_in_net_worth`.
  * Renaming/fixing columns to align with the current data model.
* Imported account data using an `accounts_import` staging table to map institution names to UUID foreign keys and populate required `household_id` values.
* Imported account balances using a `balance_import` staging table, including mapping account names to account UUIDs and filling missing `as_of_date` values.
* Updated the `bills` schema:

  * Replaced `due_day` with `next_due_date`.
  * Removed deprecated `paid_with`.
  * Added `billing_cycle` and `manual_or_auto`.
* Created a `bills_import` staging table to support CSV imports and UUID mapping.
* Normalized legacy payment status values (`Due`, `Current`, `Overdue`) to the current schema values (`unpaid`, `cleared`).
* Updated the Bills relationship to reference **Institutions** instead of **Accounts**, including changing the foreign key constraint.

### Notes

* Staging tables (`accounts_import`, `balance_import`, `bills_import`, `debts_import`) proved to be an effective migration strategy for converting legacy AppSheet CSV exports into the normalized Supabase schema while preserving referential integrity.
* Legacy category names required mapping to the new canonical category taxonomy during import.
## 2026-07-28 – Bills & Debts Schema Migration and Import Updates

### Completed

* Migrated Bills data model to support flexible scheduling:

  * Replaced `due_day` with `next_due_date`.
  * Added `billing_cycle` and `manual_or_auto`.
  * Removed deprecated `paid_with` field.
  * Updated bill imports to use staging tables for CSV migration.
* Created and used `bills_import` staging table:

  * Added support for mapping CSV category names to category UUIDs.
  * Added support for mapping institution references before inserting into production tables.
  * Normalized legacy payment statuses:

    * `Due` → `unpaid`
    * `Overdue` → `unpaid`
    * `Current` → `cleared`
* Updated Bills relationship model:

  * Changed bill ownership relationship from Accounts to Institutions.
  * Updated foreign key mapping so `bills.institution_id` references `institutions.id`.

### Debts Migration

* Created `debts_import` staging table for CSV migration.
* Updated debt imports to support:

  * Category UUID mapping.
  * Institution UUID mapping.
  * Household UUID population.
  * Legacy boolean payment status conversion:

    * `TRUE` → `cleared`
    * `FALSE` / `NULL` → `unpaid`
* Added data cleanup for required fields:

  * Populated missing `on_payment_plan` values with `FALSE`.
  * Populated missing `interest_rate` values with `0`.
* Updated Debts relationship model:

  * Migrated debt references from Accounts to Institutions.
  * Updated foreign key mapping so `debts.institution_id` references `institutions.id`.

### Schema Improvements

* Continued migration away from CSV/AppSheet-friendly structures toward normalized Supabase relationships.
* Standardized the separation between:

  * **Institution** = company/vendor owed money (GCI, MoneyLion, Aaron's, etc.)
  * **Account** = financial account used to pay or track money movement (checking, savings, credit card, etc.)
* Continued using staging import tables (`*_import`) as the standard migration process for converting legacy data into normalized UUID-based schemas.

### Notes

* Remaining cleanup may include removing legacy fields after validation (`due_day`, old account references, etc.).
* Future scheduling improvements should keep Bills and Debts aligned around shared recurrence concepts (`next_due_date`, `billing_cycle`, and related scheduling fields).
